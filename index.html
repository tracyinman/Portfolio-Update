        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I’m an aspiring web developer who loves everything about the web. I was born in England and I've lived in lots of different places throughout the UK, but I'm currently living in Spain.</p>
        <p>My background is in office administration and before moving to Spain I was an Office Manager at Cambridge University.  I've always had an interest in web development and I'm keen to expand my knowledge in that area.</p>
      </div> 

      <div class="card">
        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>I want to master the process of building web sites and increase my knowledge, skills and abilities in:</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I’d like to work as a freelancer developing websites for individuals and companies, and also possibly work remotely for a web design company.</p>

        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
          <img class="img" alt="Ipswich Speedway Photo" src="images/speedway.jpg">
          <p>I am a big speedway fan and follow the <a href="http://ipswichwitches.co">Ipswich Witches</a> from Suffolk in England and the individual World Championship.</p>
        <p>Obviously this is proving more difficult to do from Spain but I'm managing to keep in touch with what's going on.</p>
          <p>I also enjoy photography, watching movies and exploring my new home.</p>

        <h2>Big Cats</h2>
          <img class="img" alt="Photo of Amur Leopard" src="images/Amur-leopard.jpg">
          <p>I am passionate about Big Cats (and small ones for that matter!).  I love to photograph them and promote awareness of their endangerment.</p>
          <p>This is a photo of an Amur Leopard.  There are only approximately 70 adults remaining in the wild.  This photo was taken at the <a href="http://whf.org.uk">Wildlife Heritage Foundation</a> in the UK.</p>
